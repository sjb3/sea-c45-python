I have been in Biotech research at UW as a Research Scientist and lately, I
felt like I am hitting the walls.  
..* In fact, it is.  **The dismal cold reality** is _present_.  As a bench scientist I can see the changes; from web bench work to informatics.  
..1. For last couple of years I have witnessd many labs are downsizing, closing and scientsts are leaving without any hopes and promises besides ongoing dwindling funding issues and threats.

Since I realised the cold realities I've been looking for answers, directions and hopes and I saw a glimpse of hope that maybe informatics can open a new door for me.
- Lately I took some intro to computational bio and understood where the biotech research's heading.
+ Since that I wanted to take some css courses and this coding school was available right in SLU.
I still not 100% certain whether I made the right decision but merely hoping that this course will show me the way for ~my next chapter of life and career~.
