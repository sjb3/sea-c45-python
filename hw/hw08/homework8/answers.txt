Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

Problem 3:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 38, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

-Program fails to execute as we anticipate; because the line numbers to be read not specified for the gc basepairs (other lines contain different data set, only the linenum%4==2 lines have the DNA bp data).  Thus python fails to read through to count bp’s.

-Because of the initial gc count value is not specified, python fails to count them.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
AT-content: 0.2844969259259259

Problem 5:

G content 5738773
C content 5879128
A content 7701287
T content 7661547

Problem 6:

*
Sample_1.fastq and sample 2, at a glance, are same(by the length of the seq variables). HOWEVER if you look into the data set,
their GC and AT contents/ratio and total count variables are different .  As results, sample_1.fastq and sample 2 are different(see below).

2)sample_1.fastq

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
G content 5738773
C content 5879128
AT-content: 0.2844969259259259
A content 7701287
T content 7661547
Total count variables= 26980735
The length of the seq variables= 27000000
AT/GC ratio 1.3223416174746196


3)sample_2.fastq
GC-content: 0.45105133333333336
G content 6103168
C content 6075218
AT-content: 0.274056462962963
A content 7467696
T content 7331353
Total count variables= 26977435
The length of the seq variables= 27000000
AT/GC ratio 1.2151896811285174

**
By the same token, test-high-gc-1 and -2 and test-moderate-gc-1 and -2 seem to have same/similar length.  However, qualitatively, their GC contents and GC/AT ratios are not equal to each other.  Thus, you can conclude that they are not the same samples.


8)test-high-gc-1.fastq
GC-content: 0.5994
G content 12176
C content 11800
AT-content: 0.1983
A content 7970
T content 7894
Total count variables= 39840
The length of the seq variables= 40000
AT/GC ratio 0.6616616616616616


9)test-high-gc-2.fastq
GC-content: 0.79775
G content 15955
C content 15955
AT-content: 0.0991375
A content 3908
T content 4023
Total count variables= 39841
The length of the seq variables= 40000
AT/GC ratio 0.2485427765590724


10)test-moderate-gc-1.fastq
GC-content: 0.495025
G content 9818
C content 9983
AT-content: 0.2505
A content 10077
T content 9963
Total count variables= 39841
The length of the seq variables= 40000
AT/GC ratio 1.0120700974698247


11)test-moderate-gc-2.fastq
GC-content: 0.399275
G content 7972
C content 7999
AT-content: 0.298
A content 11813
T content 12027
Total count variables= 39811
The length of the seq variables= 40000
AT/GC ratio 1.4927055287708972


***

In conclusion, the length of the seq variables can easily mislead to wrong conclusion due to its error prone quantitative nature( however, it can be used for quick sorting for screening. )

On the other hand other two qualifiers can provision better data to examine their characters as they can offer more detailed scopes, regarding individual nucleotides and their total sum.  



Problem 7:

AT/GC ratio 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

low GC content (AT is more present, ~ 1.3 times more)

Collaboration:

Google/No one

Reflection:

Wish I studied Unix-Git more to work faster and effectively
Some questions, i wasn’t understand right away so i had to read it several times.
I have different background and sometimes it’s wording is very hard to decipher.
For the future students, be prepare yourself, it’s no easy ride at all.
