Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

Problem 3:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 38, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

-Program fails to execute as we anticipate; because the line numbers to be read not specified for the gc basepairs (other lines contain different data set, only the linenum%4==2 lines have the DNA bp data).  Thus python fails to read through to count bp’s.

-Because of the initial gc count value is not specified, python fails to count them.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
AT-content: 0.5689938518518518

Problem 5:

G content 11617901
C content 11617901
A content 15362834
T content 15362834

Problem 6:

*
Sample_1.fastq and sample 2, at a glance, are same(by the length of the seq variables). HOWEVER if you look into the data set,
their GC and AT contents/ratio and total count variables are different .  As results, sample_1.fastq and sample 2 are different(see below).

2)python3 dna_analysis.py data/sample_1.fastq:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
G content 11617901
C content 11617901
AT-content: 0.5689938518518518
A content 15362834
T content 15362834
Total count variables= 53961470
The length of the seq variables= 27000000

3)python3 dna_analysis.py data/sample_2.fastq:

GC-content: 0.45105133333333336
G content 12178386
C content 12178386
AT-content: 0.548112925925926
A content 14799049
T content 14799049
Total count variables= 53954870
The length of the seq variables= 27000000

**
By the same token, test-high-gc-1 and test-moderate-gc-2 are deleted from the comparison despite the same length of the seq variables.
if you look further of test-high-gc-2 and test-moderate-gc-1 their length of the seq variables are same length and the total count variables.
However, if you examine carefully their nature of the nucleotides, 
test-high-gc-2 has higher GC contents than test-moderate-GC-1.  Thus, they are not same DNA sequences.

8)python3 dna_analysis.py data/test-high-gc-1.fastq:

GC-content: 0.5994
G content 23976
C content 23976
AT-content: 0.3966
A content 15864
T content 15864
Total count variables= 79680
The length of the seq variables= 40000

GC-content: 0.79775
G content 31910
C content 31910
AT-content: 0.198275
A content 7931
T content 7931
Total count variables= 79682

GC-content: 0.495025
G content 19801
C content 19801
AT-content: 0.501
A content 20040
T content 20040
Total count variables= 79682
The length of the seq variables= 40000

11)python3 dna_analysis.py data/test-moderate-gc-2.fastq:

GC-content: 0.399275
G content 15971
C content 15971
AT-content: 0.596
A content 23840
T content 23840
Total count variables= 79622
The length of the seq variables= 40000

***

Apparently, the length of the seq variables can easily mislead to wrong conclusion due to its error prone nature( however, it can be used for quick sorting for screening. )

On the other hand other two qualifiers can provision better data to examine their characters as they can offer more detailed scopes, regarding individual nucleotides and their total sum.  



Problem 7:

AT/GC ratio 4.897561546202294e-08

Problem 8:

Moderate GC content (43% GC content)

Google/No one

Reflection:

Wish I studied Unix-Git more to work faster and effectively
Some questions, i wasn’t understand right away so i had to read it several times.
I have different background and sometimes it’s wording is very hard to decipher.
For the future students, be prepare yourself, it’s no easy ride at all.
